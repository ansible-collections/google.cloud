      - "* LEAST_REQUEST - An algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts
        and picks the host which has fewer active requests."
      - "* RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing
        to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a
        host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests."

        address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to
        the load balancer."
